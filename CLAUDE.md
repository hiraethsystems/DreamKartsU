# DreamKartsU: rules for Claude Code

Wii U (and Linux host) port of DreamKarts by Rich Stokes. The plan, the
milestones and the progress log are in `PORT_PLAN.md`.

## Rules for unattended work

- Read `PORT_PLAN.md` and the progress log first, every session.
- Work milestone by milestone. Commit small and often with clear
  messages. Tag at each milestone's end.
- Never push to any remote other than `origin` (hiraethsystems/DreamKartsU),
  never force-push `main`.
- Rich agreed to Wii U consoles on his live server, dcvmu.com (Aisling,
  2026-11-08), so release builds use it, as the Dreamcast does. Test and
  autotest builds still never connect to it, nor to any server other than
  one started locally by the test scripts, unless Aisling asks for a live
  run. It is Rich's server: no load testing, and test clients are named
  `AT...` so his alerts skip them.
- Never run `sudo`. If a package is missing, write the exact install
  command in the progress log under **Needs Aisling** and continue with
  something else.
- Upstream code: shim first, edit last, mark every edit `/* DKU: */` and
  list it in `UPSTREAM.md`.
- Play like the Dreamcast, build for the Wii U: keep game rules, simulation
  and network data as upstream has them (cross-play needs that), but write
  the hardware side (rendering, audio, threads) the best way for the Wii U,
  using its GPU and cores, not copies of how the Dreamcast does the work.
  `PORT_PLAN.md` section 2, principle 4.
- A milestone is not done until its automated check passes. Do not mark
  work done on the basis of "it compiles" where the plan asks for a test.
- When blocked by something only the console can answer, write the
  question in **Needs Aisling**, choose the most reasonable assumption,
  note it, and carry on.
- Keep `PORT_PLAN.md` honest: if a plan item turns out wrong, change the
  plan and say why in the log.

## Layout notes

- `tools/wiiu.py` sends builds to the console and reads its logs over the
  network (`TESTING.md`, "Working from the PC"). It talks only to the address
  in `WIIU_IP` or the git-ignored `.wiiu-console`.
- `upstream/` is the `projects/games/dreamkarts` folder and
  `upstream_common/` is `projects/common`, both from
  richstokes/dreamcast-homebrew at the SHA in `UPSTREAM.md`.
- `third_party/sh4zam/` is SH4ZAM at the commit upstream's
  `tools/update-sh4zam.sh` pins.
- Toolchain: `$DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro` (wut, wut-tools). CafeGLSL's
  `glslcompiler.elf` is fetched to `tools/bin/` by `tools/get_cafeglsl.sh`.
