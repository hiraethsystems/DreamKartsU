# DreamKartsU: Wii U port plan

Port of **DreamKarts** by Rich Stokes (Dreamcast, KallistiOS) to the Wii U
(devkitPro wut, Aroma), with online play against real Dreamcasts on the
same lobby server.

- Upstream: https://github.com/richstokes/dreamcast-homebrew/tree/main/projects/games/dreamkarts (MIT)
- This repo: https://github.com/hiraethclub/DreamKartsU
- Dev machine: Debian 13, x86_64. Work lives in `~/WiiUDev/DreamKartsU`.

This file is the source of truth for Claude Code. Read it at the start of
every session, work through the milestones in order, and update the
**Progress log** at the bottom as you go.

## 1. What the original is (surveyed 3 Nov 2026)

About 32,000 lines of C99 (gnu17) in `src/`, plus:

| Part | What it is | Port impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `render.c` (959 lines), `xform.S`, `blobs.S` | PowerVR Tile Accelerator renderer: CPU transform with SH4ZAM, near-plane clipping, store-queue submission, SH-4 assembly hot paths | **Rewrite.** Replace with a GX2 backend implementing the same `render.h` API. `render.c` has C reference paths (`-DDK_XF_CHECK`) for every assembly routine: port from those, drop the assembly. |
| `render.h` | Clean renderer API: `r_header`, `r_strip`, `r_mesh`, `r_mesh_kv`, `r_billboard*`, `r_quad2d*`, `r_modvol`, matrix helpers | **Keep.** This is the seam the port hangs on. |
| `world*.c`, `fx.c`, `hud.c`, `items.c` etc. | Game and scene code, mostly calling `render.h`; some direct `pvr_*` calls (fog tables, background colour, `pvr_poly_hdr_t` handles, list switching) | Keep, satisfied by a KOS compatibility shim (`pvr_fog_*`, `pvr_set_bg_color`, `pvr_list_t`, opaque `pvr_poly_hdr_t`). |
| `kart.c`, `track.c`, `gp.c`, `roam.c` | Physics and race logic. No hardware calls. | Keep unchanged. |
| SH4ZAM (`third_party/sh4zam`, fetched by `../../../tools/sh4zam.mk`) | Maths library | Keep. It has a portable software backend (`SHZ_BACKEND SHZ_SW`) chosen automatically on non-SH4 targets. Anything using XMTRX state (`shz_xmtrx_*`) runs in C emulation: correct but check render code that relies on XMTRX being "loaded". |
| `audio.c` | AICA PCM effects (`snd_sfx_*`), CD-DA music streamed from the GD-ROM, a jukebox thread with a KOS mutex | **Rewrite** the backend: software mixer for 22050 Hz mono s16 effects plus streamed music files. |
| `input.c`, `rumble.c` | Maple controllers, Dreamcast keyboard for chat, Puru Puru pack | **Rewrite** for VPAD (GamePad), KPAD (Pro Controller, Classic Controller, Wii Remote), USB keyboard (`nsyskbd`) or the on-screen keyboard (`nn_swkbd`) for chat. Rumble on GamePad. |
| `save.c`, `vmuscreen.c` | VMU save file and VMU LCD graphics | Saves to SD. VMU screen can become a GamePad display later (optional). |
| `net.c`, `online.c`, `chat.c`, `spectate.c` | UDP client for the lobby server, BSD-style sockets on KOS | Mostly keep. wut provides BSD sockets (`wutsocket`). |
| `netlink.c`, `projects/common/dialup.c` | Bringing up the BBA or dial-up modem (PPP) | Replace with a stub: Wii U network is up already. `dialup.c` lives outside the game folder upstream and is not needed. |
| `assets/generated/*.h` | Models, props, metrics as C arrays | Keep. Endian-neutral. |
| `assets/generated/textures.pak` | Twiddled RGB565 / ARGB4444 textures with mips, little-endian 16-bit words, 3.4 MB | Convert. Generate a Wii U pack from `tools/build_textures.py` (untwiddled, byte order and GX2 tiling sorted out), or untwiddle and byte-swap at load. Prefer the build-time route. |
| `assets/generated/sfx.pak` | 16-bit mono little-endian PCM at 22050 Hz | Byte-swap at load or generate a big-endian pack. |
| Music | Nine Pixabay tracks (Alex Morgan), downloaded by `tools/build_music.py` from dcvmu.com and pressed as CD-DA | Convert to OGG Vorbis (or keep 22050/44100 PCM if simpler) and stream from the SD card or the .wuhb content folder. |
| `server/` | Go lobby server, bot client `dk-bot`, recorded demo races | **Gold for testing.** Run the lobby server locally on Debian and race against `dk-bot` with no Dreamcast needed. |
| `autotest.c` + `VARIANT=autotest` | CPU drives the player for a whole race and prints `DK AUTOTEST: PASS` / `FAIL` with frame timings | **Gold for unattended work.** Port it first and use it as the regression test at every milestone. |
| `perfhud.c`, `prof.c`, `film.c`, `flappy.c` | Profiler overlay, trailer filming, a minigame | Port perfhud/prof cheaply; `film` is optional. |

### 1.1 Why online cross-play is realistic

`server/PROTOCOL.md` says the design is **state sync, not lockstep**: each
console simulates its own kart and sends its state 12 times a second; remote
karts are interpolated. So the Wii U does **not** need bit-identical
physics with the SH-4. Every packet field is packed explicitly,
little-endian, byte by byte ("bytes, not structs"), and there are no raw
pointer casts on buffers in the C. A big-endian client can speak it as long
as the encode/decode helpers are used unchanged.

Constraints:

- The server checks `DK_NET_PROTO`, `DK_NET_BUILD` and `DK_NET_MIN_BUILD`
  (`src/net_version.h`, currently 4 / 32 / 30). The Wii U build must be the
  same game version as the Dreamcasts it plays: when upstream bumps these,
  the port must merge upstream before it can play online again.
- Emerald slots come from a seed derived from lobby, race id and track:
  integer code, so it matches across CPUs. Check that the derivation uses no
  floats.
- The live server (dcvmu.com) is Rich's. He agreed to Wii U consoles on
  it (Aisling, 2026-11-08). **Test builds still never connect to it**:
  online testing uses a local lobby server unless Aisling asks for a live
  run.

### 1.2 Big-endian and PowerPC gotchas (check all of these)

1. **`char` is unsigned on PowerPC** and signed on SH-4. Build with
   `-fsigned-char` everywhere, or audit every `char` used in arithmetic.
2. `textures.pak` 16-bit words and `sfx.pak` samples are little-endian.
3. Save file format: write explicit little- or big-endian, never structs.
4. Any `union` or bitfield used to reinterpret bytes.
5. `uint64_t` timers: KOS `timer_ms_gettime64` becomes `OSGetSystemTime`
   converted with `OSTicksToMilliseconds`.
6. Unaligned access is fine on PPC, but keep the explicit packing anyway.
7. `-ffast-math` on SH-4 used FSCA/FSRRA approximations. PPC results will
   differ slightly. Fine for state sync; do not "fix" physics constants.

### 1.3 Renderer translation notes (PVR to GX2)

- **Lists.** PVR draws opaque (OP), punch-through (PT, alpha test) and
  translucent (TR) lists. Map to three passes in that order: opaque with
  depth write, punch-through with alpha test (`discard` below 0.5 or the
  PVR's cutoff), translucent with blending and the header's z-write flag.
- **Translucent sorting.** PVR can sort translucent polygons per pixel.
  Check whether `pvr_init` enables autosort; if it does, translucent
  submission order may not be back to front. Start by drawing in submission
  order and look for artefacts on foliage, smoke and water before adding
  any sorting.
- **Transforms.** The Dreamcast path does the whole transform on the CPU
  and submits screen-space vertices with 1/w. On Wii U, keep the CPU
  transform and near-plane clipping from the C reference code at first, but
  emit **clip-space** positions (x, y, z, w) so the GPU does perspective
  correct texturing. Moving transforms into the vertex shader is a later
  optimisation, only if profiling asks for it.
- **Header flags** (`HF_*` in `render.h`): additive blend, no fog, clamp,
  no z write, no z test, point filtering, z write for translucents,
  specular/offset colour. Each maps to GX2 blend, depth, sampler state and a
  shader variant or uniform.
- **Offset colour** (`HF_SPEC`): PVR adds a second per-vertex colour after
  texturing. Add a second colour attribute and add it in the pixel shader.
- **Fog.** `pvr_fog_table_custom` / `pvr_fog_table_linear` / `pvr_fog_far_depth`
  with a fog colour. Implement as a 128-entry fog table texture or uniform
  array indexed by depth, matching the PVR's lookup on 1/w, so the custom
  tables in `world.c` look the same.
- **Mip bias** (`PVR_MIPBIAS_*`): GX2 sampler LOD bias.
- **Modifier volumes** (`r_modvol`, 15 call sites): shadows that darken
  opaque and punch-through surfaces inside a closed volume to
  `DK_SHADOW_SCALE`. Implement as stencil shadow volumes (depth-fail or
  depth-pass) then a full-screen darken where stencil is set. Acceptable
  interim fallback: draw nothing, keep a TODO.
- **Background colour** (`pvr_set_bg_color`): clear colour.
- **Resolution.** The game draws 640x480 with `r_set_viewport` for split
  screen rows. Render to a 640x480 colour buffer first, then scale to the
  TV (1280x720, pillarboxed 4:3) and the GamePad (854x480). Widescreen is
  milestone 7.
- **Textures.** RGB565 maps to `GX2_SURFACE_FORMAT_UNORM_R5_G6_B5` and
  ARGB4444 to the 4444 format with a component swizzle; check wut's
  `gx2/enum.h` for exact names and confirm byte order on the console (Cemu
  is not a reliable judge of byte order bugs). Simplest correct start:
  convert to RGBA8 at load. Optimise later.
- **Shaders.** Write GLSL, compile offline with CafeGLSL's
  `glslcompiler.elf` (works on Linux) to `.gsh`, load with
  `WHBGfxLoadGFDShaderGroup`. Uniforms must live in uniform blocks and the
  code must call `GX2SetShaderMode(GX2_SHADER_MODE_UNIFORM_BLOCK)`; Cemu
  forgives forgetting this and the real console does not.

## 2. Architecture of the port

**Two targets, one game (Aisling, 2026-11-03).** The Linux PC build is a
maintained, playable target alongside the Wii U, not just a test rig.
Every feature that is not Wii U hardware (GamePad screen, GX2) lands on
both. `tools/test_host.sh` passing is part of every later milestone's
check, and a playable PC build ships with each release.

Principles:

1. **Touch upstream source as little as possible.** Prefer shim headers
   and replacement files over edits. When an upstream edit is unavoidable,
   keep it tiny, mark it `/* DKU: reason */`, and list it in `UPSTREAM.md`
   so merges stay easy. Rich is still actively developing the game, and
   cross-play depends on staying in step with him.
2. **Two hosts, one game.** A Linux host build (SDL2 + OpenGL) exists so
   Claude Code can build, run and test without the Wii U. The Wii U build
   shares everything except `render_*`, `plat_*` and the audio output.
3. **Every milestone ends with a green automated check** plus a tagged
   commit Aisling can test on hardware.
4. **Plays like the Dreamcast, built for the Wii U (Aisling, 2026-11-07).**
   Game rules, simulation, timing and network data stay as upstream has
   them: that is what cross-play with real Dreamcasts depends on. The parts
   that face the hardware (rendering, audio, threading) are written the
   best way for the Wii U, using its GPU and its three cores, not copies of
   how the Dreamcast does the work. The first case: Dreamcast games
   transform, light and clip vertices on the CPU because the PowerVR could
   not; on the Wii U that moves to vertex shaders. Where this needs upstream
   edits (mainly `render.c` and `models.c`), keep the game's decisions in
   upstream and move only the per-vertex work, behind a narrow hook, marked
   and listed in `UPSTREAM.md` as principle 1 asks. What the player sees
   must still match: the host's reference images stay the check.

## 3. Milestones

Each milestone lists its **done when** criteria. Do not start the next
milestone until they pass, apart from work that is blocked on hardware
testing (note that in the progress log and carry on).

### M0. Repo and toolchain (supervised, short)

- Switch `LICENSE` to MIT: keep `Copyright (c) 2026 Rich Stokes`, add
  `Copyright (c) 2026 Aisling (hiraethclub)` for the port. Keep
  `CREDITS.md` and its licence notices; add wut, CafeGLSL, SDL2 and any
  other new dependency.
- Import upstream with `git subtree` (or a plain copy plus SHA in
  `UPSTREAM.md`) into `upstream/`.
- Pin SH4ZAM into `third_party/` (upstream fetches it via a monorepo
  `tools/sh4zam.mk`; reproduce the pinned version that makefile names).
- Verify the toolchain: `$DEVKITPRO`, `$DEVKITPPC`, `wut`, `wut-tools`
  (`wuhbtool`, `elf2rpl`), `ppc-portlibs`/`wiiu-portlibs` as needed. Build
  one wut sample-style hello world to `.rpx` and `.wuhb`.
- Fetch CafeGLSL's `glslcompiler.elf` release and confirm it compiles a
  trivial vertex/pixel pair to `.gsh`.
- Check whether Debian 13 can provide a big-endian PowerPC cross compiler
  plus `qemu-user` (e.g. `gcc-powerpc-linux-gnu` and `qemu-user-static`).
  If yes, `test_be.sh` becomes possible. If not, record that and rely on
  Cemu and console testing for byte order.
- Write `CLAUDE.md` (section 5).

**Done when:** hello world `.wuhb` builds; `.gsh` compiles; upstream is
imported with its SHA recorded; licence and credits updated; committed and
tagged `m0`.

### M1. Platform shim and Linux host build, headless autotest

- Write the shim so the untouched upstream files compile on the host:
  maple, timers, mutexes and threads (or pthreads), `snd_*`, VMU file
  system, `pvr_*` entry points used outside `render.c`.
- Write `render_gl.c` implementing `render.h` with OpenGL 3.3 core:
  textures from the pack, the three lists, header flags, fog, offset colour.
  Modifier volumes may be stubbed in this milestone.
- `plat_host.c`: SDL2 window at 640x480, keyboard and SDL gamepad input,
  audio through the shared mixer (silent is fine in headless mode).
- Headless mode: offscreen framebuffer (EGL surfaceless, or SDL with a
  hidden window under `xvfb-run`), so tests can run without a display.
- Port the autotest variant. Add a screenshot dump (PNG) at fixed frames
  for each track, as `DK_CAPTURE` does upstream.

**Done when:** `tools/test_host.sh` builds the host autotest, runs a full
race on every one of the eight tracks and prints `DK AUTOTEST: PASS` for
each; screenshots are saved under `captures/host/`. Tag `m1`.

### M2. Renderer fidelity on host

- Untwiddle textures correctly, mips included (`tools/pvr_texture.py`
  documents the layout).
- Fog tables matching the PVR lookup; mip bias; punch-through cutoff.
- Offset colour, additive effects, sparks, flames, billboards, HUD, fonts,
  title screen, menus, split screen.
- Stencil shadow volumes for `r_modvol`.
- Compare against upstream screenshots in `docs/screenshots/` of the
  upstream repo where available. If Flycast can be built on Debian, an
  optional reference capture of the original game per track helps.

**Done when:** every track renders without obvious missing geometry,
wrong colours or z-fighting in the captured screenshots; a contact sheet
`captures/host/contact.png` is generated for Aisling to eyeball. Tag `m2`.

### M3. Wii U bring-up (first hardware checkpoint)

- `plat_wiiu.c`: ProcUI main loop (home button, foreground/background
  correctly), WHBGfx init, swap interval 1 (60 Hz; the game runs one fixed
  physics step per displayed frame, `DK_DT = 1/60`).
- `render_gx2.c`: port of `render_gl.c` to GX2 and `.gsh` shaders. Same
  vertex layout, same passes. Dynamic vertex buffers per frame with
  `GX2Invalidate` on CPU writes.
- Assets: pack textures and sfx for big-endian, embed them in the RPX (as
  upstream does with `.incbin`) or load from the .wuhb content folder.
- Logging over UDP (`WHBLogUdpInit`, receive with `udplogserver` from
  wut-tools) so test builds can report `DK AUTOTEST` lines over the network.
- Build `DreamKartsU.wuhb` with name, author, icon (`assets/icon.png`
  resized to 128x128) and a TV/DRC splash.

**Done when:** the Wii U build compiles clean with `-Wall -Wextra`, the
autotest variant boots to a finished race in Cemu (if it can be run
headless on this machine; if not, record why), and release build boots to
the title screen. Tag `m3`. **Stop here and tell Aisling it is ready to
test on hardware** (see section 4), then continue with M4 work that does
not depend on her results.

### M4. Input, audio, saves

- Input: GamePad (VPAD) as player 1 by default; Pro Controller, Classic
  Controller and Wii Remote held sideways via KPAD. Map to the `Pad` struct
  the game expects, including analogue triggers as thresholds like
  upstream. Two-player split screen with any two controllers.
- Rumble: GamePad motor for the `rumble.c` events.
- Audio: shared software mixer for effects, kart loops and pitch changes
  (`audio_sfx_pitch`, `audio_plane`); music streamed on a worker thread;
  fades and the jukebox behaviour from `audio.c`. ~~OGG with stb_vorbis~~:
  the MP3s themselves with dr_mp3 (public domain), since this machine has
  no Vorbis encoder or ffmpeg and playing the source files avoids a second
  lossy encode. ~~SDL2 audio~~: AX (`sndcore2`), since there is no
  wiiu-sdl2 here. (Changed at M4, see the log.)
- Music build step: reuse upstream `tools/build_music.py` download and
  checksum logic; copy the MP3s and measure their loudness instead of
  pressing CD-DA WAVs.
- Saves: same data `save.c` keeps, to
  `fs:/vol/external01/wiiu/apps/DreamKartsU/DREAMKARTS.vmu` (SD), explicit
  byte order, atomic write (temp file then rename). Upstream saves
  settings only (name, music, volume, custom kart), no race records.
- (Chat entry moved to M6, Aisling 2026-11-04: only online play uses it.)

**Done when:** host autotest still passes; Wii U build compiles; sound
plays in Cemu; settings ~~and records~~ survive a restart in Cemu (there
are no records to save). Tag `m4`.

### M5. Complete offline game

- All modes from upstream work: single race, grand prix, split screen,
  free roam, time trials, minigame, sound test, options.
- Wii U extras that do not change gameplay: choice of TV only, GamePad
  only (off-TV play), or mirrored; in two-player, optionally player 1 on
  TV and player 2 on GamePad full screen instead of split screen.
- Performance: perf HUD ported; target a locked 60 fps in four-kart
  split screen on Tsudoken Drift and Neon Skyway (the heaviest per the
  upstream notes).
- **Native rendering (added 2026-11-07, principle 4).** Build 2 on the
  console: races at 30-60 fps, track select about 20, with the CPU's main
  core the limit and the GPU idle. Steps:
  (a) time the parts of a frame on the console: done, the autotest's own
      profiler (`DK PC` lines) over the network;
  (b) render.c's strips and meshes go to the GPU untransformed with their
      matrix (`port/render_native.c`, ta.h world batches); the vertex shader
      transforms, the GPU clips at upstream's near plane and culls back
      faces. Kart lighting stays on the CPU (it is per colour group, not
      per vertex) and fog was already per pixel. Billboards and streaks go
      through `r_strip`, so they take this path too; 2D and shadow volumes
      stay screen-space. Check: `tools/test_native.sh` (the CPU path and
      the GPU path draw the same pictures and run the same races);
  (c) what is left of the per-frame CPU work. Done first, from console
      timings: frames are built in place in GPU memory (no copy) and
      textures are uploaded in the PVR's own 16-bit formats (no texel
      conversion). A race frame is now about 2.7 ms of CPU on core 1, so
      spreading work over the other cores and keeping static world
      geometry on the GPU are not needed for one player. They are kept for
      when two-player split screen or online play (M6) measure over
      budget, as are the remaining texture uploads (about 18 ms for 21
      textures at the race intro, once per race).

**Done when:** host autotest passes on all tracks, big-endian autotest
passes if `test_be.sh` exists, Wii U build compiles. Tag `m5`. Second
hardware checkpoint.

### M6. Online, local server first

- Sockets via wut's BSD layer; `netlink_port.c` reports the link up at once;
  DNS for the server name via `getaddrinfo`.
- Server address configurable (options menu and a `server.txt` on SD).
  Default during development: the local machine's LAN address.
- `tools/test_online.sh`: build and run the Go lobby server from
  `upstream/server` locally (`go` from Debian's repositories), start one or
  more `dk-bot` clients, run the host client against it in autotest mode,
  pass when a full race completes with remote karts present and results
  received.
- Keep `net_version.h` exactly as upstream. Do not invent a platform field
  in the protocol; that is Rich's server and his decision.
- Chat entry (moved from M4): USB keyboard via `nsyskbd`, feeding the
  KOS-style queue. Without a keyboard, upstream's own on-screen keys
  (pad-driven, as on the Dreamcast) do the typing, so `nn_swkbd` is not
  needed (plan change 2026-11-08). The PC build's keyboard moves to M7:
  there it also drives pad 0, so typing needs a mode switch, which goes
  with M7's key rebinding.

**Done when:** `test_online.sh` passes on the host build; the Wii U build
connects to the local server in Cemu or on console. Tag `m6`.
Cross-play against real Dreamcasts on dcvmu.com: **agreed with Rich**
(Aisling, 2026-11-08). Release builds connect there by default; the first
live race is one Aisling plays.

### M7. Polish and release

- Widescreen option (16:9 projection and HUD layout) as a setting,
  4:3 stays default to match the original.
- GamePad second screen extras, e.g. track map or the VMU-style display.
- README with build instructions, controls, credits, licences, and a clear
  "unofficial port, original by Rich Stokes" line.
- GitHub Actions build using the `devkitpro/devkitppc` Docker image,
  producing the `.wuhb` as an artifact, plus a Linux PC build (and
  `tools/test_host.sh` with the null backend) on every push.
- PC release: settings for window size and fullscreen, key rebinding,
  and music and saves working the same as on the Wii U. The keyboard
  types in the chat (moved from M6): a gamepad plugged in, or a typing
  mode, frees it from driving pad 0.
- Upstream sync procedure tested once: pull a newer upstream commit,
  re-run every test.

## 4. Hardware testing checkpoints (what Aisling does)

At tags `m3`, `m5`, `m6`, `m7`:

1. Claude Code sends the build over the network (`tools/wiiu.py dev`) and
   records its log; `TESTING.md`, "Working from the PC". Copying the
   `.wuhb` to `SD:/wiiu/apps/DreamKartsU/` still works as a fallback.
2. The log needs nothing from Aisling: the live copy lands in `logs/`, and
   `tools/wiiu.py pull-log` fetches the card's copy.
3. Play, note problems in `TESTING.md` under the tag's heading: what you
   did, what happened, a phone photo if visual.
4. Tell Claude Code "results for m3 are in TESTING.md".

---

## 5. Rules for unattended work (copy into CLAUDE.md)

- Read `PORT_PLAN.md` and the progress log first, every session.
- Work milestone by milestone. Commit small and often with clear
  messages. Tag at each milestone's end.
- Never push to any remote other than `origin` (hiraethclub/DreamKartsU),
  never force-push `main`.
- Rich agreed to Wii U consoles on his live server, dcvmu.com (Aisling,
  2026-11-08), so release builds use it, as the Dreamcast does. Test and
  autotest builds still never connect to it, nor to any server other than
  one started locally by the test scripts, unless Aisling asks for a live
  run. It is Rich's server: no load testing, and test clients are named
  `AT...` so his alerts skip them.
- Never run `sudo`. If a package is missing, write the exact install
  command in the progress log under **Needs Aisling** and continue with
  something else.
- Upstream code: shim first, edit last, mark every edit `/* DKU: */` and
  list it in `UPSTREAM.md`.
- Play like the Dreamcast, build for the Wii U: keep game rules, simulation
  and network data as upstream has them, but write the hardware side the
  best way for the Wii U (section 2, principle 4).
- A milestone is not done until its automated check passes. Do not mark
  work done on the basis of "it compiles" where the plan asks for a test.
- When blocked by something only the console can answer, write the
  question in **Needs Aisling**, choose the most reasonable assumption,
  note it, and carry on.
- Keep `PORT_PLAN.md` honest: if a plan item turns out wrong, change the
  plan and say why in the log.

## 6. Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GX2 renderer bugs that only show on console (byte order, cache flushes, uniform block mode) | High | GL host renderer as reference; UDP logging; early hardware checkpoint at M3 |
| CafeGLSL is labelled experimental | Medium | Keep shaders simple (no geometry/compute); offline compile so failures show at build time |
| Translucency order differs from PVR autosort | Medium | Detect visually at M2; add per-list sorting by depth if needed |
| Upstream changes the protocol or build number | Certain, ongoing | Subtree layout and minimal edits so merges are routine |
| Cross-play acceptance | Depends on Rich | Ask him before touching his server |
| Music licence | Low | Pixabay tracks are bundled in a game the same way upstream does; keep the credits |

## Progress log

### Needs Aisling

- ~~Packages, git identity, GitHub push~~: done by Aisling 2026-11-03;
  pushes work (`gh`, HTTPS).
- ~~Music source (M4)~~: Aisling decided 2026-11-03 to use the same
  music as the original. Upstream `tools/build_music.py` may fetch the
  Pixabay tracks from `https://dcvmu.com/dreamkarts/music/` as a one-off
  asset download at M4. The rule still stands for game builds: no build
  ever connects to dcvmu.com.

- ~~Network setup~~: done 2026-11-07; build 2 sent, run and logged over
  the network.
- ~~Console retest (2026-11-06)~~: water, stutter and power-ups all look
  right on build 7 (Aisling, 2026-11-07); races hold 60 fps.
- **Rumble (parked by Aisling, 2026-11-07):** none on the GamePad in builds
  7, 17 and the build 18 rumble test, though the console accepts every
  call. Open when it comes back: does this GamePad rumble in a retail game
  (e.g. Mario Kart 8)? `VARIANT=rumbletest` is ready for the next try. Pro Controller and
  Wii Remote rumble are still untried. ~~Sound~~: works (Aisling,
  2026-11-07). Sheet: `TESTING.md` m4.
- **M6 on the console (2026-11-08):** a USB keyboard in the Wii U's USB
  port should type in the chat (X in a lobby) and on the name screen;
  untried, as no keyboard is attached here. Assumed to work like the
  GamePad's on-screen keys until tried. And the first live race on
  dcvmu.com with a release build: Aisling's to play (`TESTING.md` m6).
- **M3 hardware test (2026-11-04):** the m3 builds are ready to try on
  the console. What to check and where to write results: `TESTING.md`.

### Log

- 2026-11-03: plan written from a survey of upstream at the main branch of
  richstokes/dreamcast-homebrew. No code yet.
- 2026-11-03: **M0.** Cloned the port repo to `~/WiiUDev/DreamKartsU`.
  - Upstream imported as plain copies (`git archive`, not `git subtree`:
    the folder is deep in a large monorepo, so a copy plus SHA is
    simpler) at `eaee474`: `upstream/` (dreamkarts) and
    `upstream_common/` (`projects/common`, because `src/` includes
    `../../../common/dialup.h` and `softreset.h` by relative path; M1's
    shim will have to satisfy those paths). `tools/update_upstream.sh`
    does three-way merges for later syncs (tested as a no-op).
  - SH4ZAM pinned at `ad2f890` (the commit upstream's
    `tools/update-sh4zam.sh` names) in `third_party/sh4zam/`.
  - Licence switched from GPL-3.0 to MIT with both copyright lines;
    root `CREDITS.md` points at upstream's and adds wut, CafeGLSL, SDL2.
  - Toolchain: devkitPPC r51 (GCC 16.2), wut 1.9.2, wut-tools 1.3.5
    (`wuhbtool`, `elf2rpl`, `udplogserver`, `wiiload`). `port/hello`
    builds to `.rpx` and `.wuhb` with `-Wall -Wextra` and no warnings.
  - CafeGLSL v0.2.0 `glslcompiler.elf` (fetched and hash-checked by
    `tools/get_cafeglsl.sh`) compiles a uniform-block vertex/pixel pair
    to a valid `Gfx2` `.gsh`.
  - Big-endian testing: Debian 13 has `gcc-powerpc-linux-gnu` 14.2 and
    `qemu-user` 10.0, so `test_be.sh` is possible once installed.
  - Host build deps are missing (SDL2, GL/EGL headers, xvfb, Go,
    Pillow/NumPy): see Needs Aisling. Cemu 2.6 AppImage found in
    `~/Applications` for M3.
  - Check: `tools/check_m0.sh` prints `M0 CHECK: PASS`.
- 2026-11-03: **M1 in progress (not done: its check needs the GL
  renderer and screenshots, which need SDL2/GL installed).**
  - Plan change: shim-first went further than the plan expected.
    `render.c`, `input.c`, `rumble.c` and `audio.c` stay **unmodified**:
    - `port/shim/pvr_ta.c` is a software Tile Accelerator. It decodes the
      `pvr_prim` headers and `pvr_dr_*` vertex words `render.c` sends into
      per-list triangle batches (`port/ta.h`) that a backend draws. A
      backend gets screen x, y and 1/w and rebuilds clip space, which keeps
      texturing perspective-correct.
    - `port/xform_c.c` replaces `xform.S` (seven routines) in C.
    - Maple is virtual: platform controllers appear as maple controllers,
      a rumble-capable pad gets a Puru Puru pack, VMU files are files in
      the save folder (atomic writes), and the keyboard feeds a KOS-style
      queue. The AICA channel packets and `snd_sfx_*` drive
      `port/shim/snd_shim.c`'s mixer. CD-DA reports "no disc" until M4.
    - Only `netlink.c` is replaced (`port/netlink_port.c`). It refuses
      dcvmu.com and upstream's fallback IP outright; host builds always set
      `DK_NET_TEST_HOST=127.0.0.1`.
    - The one upstream edit: `src/prof.h` (literal SH-4 counter
      addresses), in `UPSTREAM.md`.
  - `make VARIANT=autotest` builds a headless host binary (null backend,
    virtual 60 Hz clock, `port/plat_headless.c`).
    `BACKEND=null tools/test_host.sh` races all 8 tracks:
    **all 8 print `DK AUTOTEST: PASS`** (about 25 s in parallel).
  - `VARIANT=xfcheck` (upstream's `DK_XF_CHECK` run against
    `port/xform_c.c`) is clean on all 8 tracks. Two causes found:
    - A real NaN: `birds.c` `flight_pos` took `powf` of IEEE `sinf(pi)`,
      which is slightly negative. Fixed with a marked edit (`UPSTREAM.md`),
      worth offering to Rich.
    - Temple Hill's remaining count is upstream's own check: bystanders bob
      by moving their strip vertices past the bounding sphere built before
      the bob (`world_props.c` / `world_mesh.c`). It is harmless and
      happens on the Dreamcast too, so `tools/test_host.sh` lists it in
      `XF_KNOWN`.
- 2026-11-03: **M1 done.** Tag `m1`.
  - `port/plat_host.c`: SDL2 window, GL 3.3 core context, keyboard and SDL
    game controllers as maple pads, rumble, mixer through SDL audio.
    `DKU_VIRTUAL_CLOCK=1` gives the headless platform's steady 60 Hz clock.
  - `port/render_gl.c`: draws the TA frame into a 640x480 FBO: OP, PT, TR
    in order; header blend, depth compare and write; PT alpha test;
    texture envs; offset colour; table and vertex fog; userclip as scissor;
    de-twiddled textures with the KOS mip chain, re-uploaded on
    `pvr_txr_load`. Depth is 1/w (as z/(1+z)) in a float buffer, cleared
    to 0. Modifier volumes (shadows) are not drawn yet (M2).
    `DKU_SHOTS` saves PNGs (zlib) to `captures/host/t<track>-f<frame>.png`.
  - `tools/test_host.sh` (GL default now) runs each track under its own
    `xvfb-run` (Mesa llvmpipe) and ends a run once its verdict prints,
    since off the console the game keeps going after it.
  - Check: **all 8 tracks `DK AUTOTEST: PASS`** in about 3 min; 28
    screenshots in `captures/host/`. Text, fog, textures and HUD look right.
  - Known artefact, for M2: in many frames, near-plane-clipped ground and
    road triangles (vertices at w = 0.25 with screen x up to about
    +-64000) are not drawn, leaving background-coloured wedges in the
    lower screen. Likely llvmpipe's fixed-point setup overflowing on such
    large coordinates. The GX2 backend will have the same limits, so the
    fix belongs in the shim or backend: clip those triangles to a guard
    band in clip space before drawing. Not yet confirmed on softpipe or a
    real GPU.
  - Not run yet: `tools/test_be.sh` (big-endian under qemu-ppc); the
    packages are now installed. First job next session.
- 2026-11-03: **Big-endian autotest passes.** `tools/test_be.sh`
  (powerpc-linux-gnu-gcc 14.2, qemu-ppc 10.0, null backend) races
  Emerald Beach (4th, 70.07 s) and Tsudoken Drift (1st, 104.98 s) to
  `DK AUTOTEST: PASS` in about 2 min 20 s. The "Terminated" lines it
  prints are the script ending each run after its verdict.
- 2026-11-03: **M2 started.** The near-plane wedges are fixed, and the
  M1 guess about them was wrong.
  - `DKU_DUMP_FRAMES` (shim) writes a frame's TA batches to
    `captures/host/<tag>-fNNNNN.ta`, numbered like the screenshots. A
    dump of an affected frame showed the TA hands the backend the
    missing road triangles. With the depth test off, llvmpipe draws
    them: large coordinates were not the problem. The road (1/w 0.31)
    lost to the sea under it (1/w 0.27) because `gl_FragDepth` was
    written from a `noperspective` 1/w varying, which comes out wrong
    on triangles the GPU clips.
  - Fix: clip z is a constant `DEPTH_K` (1/128), so the rasteriser's
    window depth is `DEPTH_K / w`, linear in screen space just as the
    PVR's 1/w is. Depth clamp on, `glClipControl` zero-to-one (float
    precision far away), no `gl_FragDepth`. Fog reads 1/w back from
    `gl_FragCoord.z`. GX2 does the same through
    `GX2SetRasterizerClipControlEx` with `halfZ` (M3). 1/w goes up to
    60 (`flappy.c`), so the scale fits.
  - `tools/contact_sheet.py` builds `captures/host/contact.png`. No
    wedges in any of the 30 frames; GL autotest PASS on all 8 tracks.
  - Runs now repeat exactly. Two runs of the same track (GL or null,
    ASLR or not) used to differ by an ulp in the sea's UVs at frame 300
    and fully by 1800: the virtual clock added real time inside the
    frame, so mid-frame timer reads jittered. `DKU_REPRO=1` (set by
    `tools/test_host.sh`) makes in-frame time 1 us per call. Two GL
    test runs give byte-identical screenshots on all 8 tracks, so
    before/after comparisons of renderer changes are now exact.
  - **Shadows (modifier volumes) drawn** in `render_gl.c` as the PVR's
    cheap shadow, in stencil: OP/PT set bit 7 where the header takes
    modifiers; each volume flips bit 0 for its faces in front of the
    surface (parity), then folds it into bit 1 (union of volumes); a
    full-screen pass scales those pixels by `shadow_scale` (0.75)
    before TR. The karts now have the hard core inside their soft blob
    shadow that upstream's `models.c` describes. GL autotest PASS on
    all 8 tracks. Not yet checked: split screen (volumes are cut per
    view by `r_modvol`, so it should hold).
  - Menus and split screen: `DKU_INPUT` (host platform) presses
    scripted buttons at given frames. `tools/capture_menus.sh` drives
    the GL release build from the title screen through the main menu,
    race setup and two-player kart select into a split-screen race,
    saving `captures/host/menu-f*.png`; the contact sheet gives them
    their own rows. Title, menus, kart select, split-screen HUDs and
    shadows all render correctly.
  - No upstream reference screenshots in the imported folder (only
    `assets/icon.png`), so the comparison M2 suggests was not possible;
    Flycast reference captures skipped (optional).
  - Big-endian rerun: PASS. Same Emerald Beach lap times as x86 but a
    different place, and Tsudoken a little different: float divergence
    between CPUs (section 1.2 item 7), expected.
- 2026-11-03: **M2 done.** Tag `m2`. Checks: `tools/test_host.sh`
  (GL) PASS on all 8 tracks, `BACKEND=null` PASS, `tools/test_be.sh`
  PASS, `tools/capture_menus.sh` PASS, and `captures/host/contact.png`
  generated (8 tracks plus menus and split screen) with no missing
  geometry, wrong colours or z-fighting that I could see.
  **Aisling:** please eyeball `captures/host/contact.png` (regenerate
  with `tools/test_host.sh && tools/capture_menus.sh &&
  tools/contact_sheet.py`; captures are not in git). Next: M3, Wii U
  bring-up.
- 2026-11-04: Aisling looked over the M2 contact sheet: looks fine.
  She confirmed the aim is the Wii U port **and** online cross-play
  with real Dreamcasts (M6), not the Wii U alone.
- 2026-11-04: **M3 done.** Tag `m3`. **Ready for the first hardware
  test** (Needs Aisling, `TESTING.md`).
  - `Makefile.wiiu` (devkitPPC + wut 1.9.2) builds
    `build/wiiu-gx2-<variant>/DreamKartsU.wuhb`; source lists and flags
    shared with the host in `sources.mk`. The game logic compiled and
    linked for the Wii U first time: wut's newlib supplies pthreads,
    BSD sockets and `clock_gettime`.
  - `port/plat_wiiu.c`: WHBProc (HOME menu, background, quit from HOME
    ends `main`), system clock, GamePad as pad 0, saves to
    `SD:/wiiu/apps/DreamKartsU/`, stdout/stderr to the UDP log and
    OSReport line by line.
  - `port/render_gx2.c`: a port of `render_gl.c` with the same passes and
    header mapping, 1/w depth through halfZ clip control, PVR textures
    to RGBA8 (little-endian reads) via linear staging surfaces and
    `GX2CopySurface`, colour attributes fetched 8-in-32 so the shaders
    match the host's, uniform blocks byte-swapped, stencil shadows, and
    the 640x480 frame blitted 4:3 to TV and GamePad. Shaders in
    `port/shaders/` (GLSL 450, CafeGLSL; `.gsh` checked in).
  - Found in Cemu: `GX2ClearDepthStencilEx` with depth 0 left the buffer
    above every depth the game draws, so only the HUD (depth test off)
    showed. Proved by flipping every compare (the world then drew,
    farthest first). Depth and stencil are now cleared by a full-screen
    quad, which does not depend on how an implementation treats the
    clear value. **Console question:** does the real GPU honour it?
    Either way the quad is correct.
  - `.wuhb`: icon and TV/GamePad splashes made from upstream's
    `assets/icon.png` by `tools/make_wuhb_art.py`.
  - `tools/cemu_run.sh` runs a `.wuhb` in Cemu 2.6 (AppImage) on a
    private Xvfb with a private copy of Aisling's settings (OpenGL,
    OSReport logging = log flag bit 17, found by bisecting), so her own
    Cemu setup is untouched. `tools/test_wiiu.sh` is the M3 check: no
    compiler warnings in any Wii U build, each track's autotest races to
    `DK AUTOTEST: PASS` in Cemu, and the release build boots to the
    title. **All 8 tracks PASS; release boots to the title** (about 5
    minutes, screenshots in `captures/wiiu/`). Cemu's fps here (min
    ~38) is the software rasteriser, not the console.
  - Fixed on all platforms: `main` reads the clock before `plat_init`,
    so the boot time underflowed; clocks now start at their first read.
  - Host checks rerun: GL and null autotests, big-endian, menu capture
    all PASS.
  - Not in M3 (M4): sound (no AX yet), Pro Controller / Wii Remote,
    rumble, keyboard.
- 2026-11-04: Plan change (Aisling): chat entry moves from M4 to M6.
  Only online play uses it, and M4 without it gets the console build to
  a state worth testing sooner (sound, music, controllers, rumble).
- 2026-11-04: **M4 done.** Tag `m4`.
  - Music: `tools/build_music.py` fetches the songs with upstream's own
    manifest/sha256 code (one-off download, allowed above) into `music/`
    (not in git) and measures loudness (`tools/music_level.c`) into
    `port/music_levels.h`. `cdda_shim.c` plays `music/NN.mp3` as the
    disc's tracks (dr_mp3), levelled and limited. Plan changed: MP3s
    instead of OGG (no encoder here), AX instead of SDL2 (no wiiu-sdl2).
  - Wii U: `audio_ax.c` (AX, two voices), KPAD controllers on ports 1-3,
    GamePad and remote rumble, music in the `.wuhb` content folder.
    wut's `nanosleep` in extra threads crashed Cemu; Wii U sleeps use
    `OSSleepTicks`.
  - Saves: the shim stores save.c's checksum little-endian, so PC and
    Wii U save files are identical. `tools/test_saves.sh` PASS (x86 and
    big-endian). Wii U save test in Cemu: WROTE then PASS, file identical
    to the PC's.
  - Checks: host null and GL autotests PASS on all 8 tracks with the new
    sound check (effects and music audible); `tools/test_be.sh` PASS;
    `tools/capture_menus.sh` PASS; `tools/test_saves.sh` PASS;
    `tools/test_wiiu.sh` PASS: no warnings, all 8 tracks race to PASS in
    Cemu with AX playing the mix and music audible, settings survive a
    Cemu restart, release boots to the title.
  - Not tested anywhere but the console: Pro / Classic / Wii Remote input
    and rumble (Cemu here has no such controllers set up). Sheet:
    `TESTING.md` m4.
- 2026-11-06: **First console run: the game loads and runs; pressing
  HOME got stuck** (Aisling). Cemu has no HOME menu, so this was found by
  reading the path, and which fix cures it is not yet known. Fixed: the
  music thread now stops and closes its file before exit (it kept
  reading the `.wuhb` while the app went away); no `GX2DrawDone` after
  ProcUI has taken the foreground; sound stops and motors go off while in
  the background; a lock-order deadlock between `cdrom_cdda_play` and the
  mixer. `DKU PROC:` and `DKU EXIT:` log lines show how far it gets.
  `VARIANT=exittest` leaves the game as "Close software" does, and
  `tools/test_wiiu.sh` now checks it. All checks PASS.
- 2026-11-06: **HOME confirmed fixed on the console** (Aisling). The fixes
  went in together, so which one cured it is not known.
- 2026-11-06: **Console report: stutter, not 60 fps, power-up glitches,
  water flooding the track select from high up** (Aisling). Changes, none
  yet proven on the console, because Cemu showed none of the symptoms:
  - Water: the depth buffer was `FLOAT_D24_S8`, a real 24-bit float on the
    GPU with nothing below 2^-15, so far geometry lost its depth. Now
    `FLOAT_X8_X24`, which is D32F with S8. Assumption: that is the cause.
  - Speed: `WHBGfxFinishRender` ends in `GX2DrawDone`, so update, commands
    and GPU work shared one refresh. The renderer now does its own swap and
    pacing with two sets of frame memory, fenced by timestamp; the HOME path
    waits for the GPU first (up to 200 ms). One GPU uniform cache invalidate
    per frame instead of per header. Sound, music, save and log threads are
    pinned off core 1.
  - Power-ups (cause not proven): textures are first uploaded when first
    used, which for power-ups means mid-race, and `GX2CopySurface` ran
    mid-frame. Uploads now run before the frame's drawing, and GPU-written
    memory is flushed from the CPU cache when allocated. De-twiddling uses a
    table, to shorten that hitch.
  - **Test log:** `SD:/wiiu/apps/DreamKartsU/DreamKartsU-build-NNNN.log`
    (`port/testlog.c`), per build, appended per boot, written about once a
    second off the game's core. Lines: all printf output, `DKU STATE:`, a
    `PERF` line a second and `HITCH` lines for frames over 20 ms
    (`port/perf_wiiu.c` explains the fields). Also live over UDP.
  - **Build number:** `tools/build_number.sh` and `BUILD_NUMBER` (checked in)
    add one when a Wii U build sees changed sources. "BUILD NNNN" shows bottom
    left (`port/build_overlay.c`); `BUILD_OVERLAY=0` in `Makefile.wiiu` takes
    it off when testing ends.
- 2026-11-07: **Working from the PC without moving the SD card**
  (Aisling's request). `tools/wiiu.py` builds, sends and starts builds with
  Wiiload, reaches the card with FTPiiU and follows the UDP log.
  `tools/test_console_tool.py` PASS against local stand-ins, including the
  real `wiiload` tool. Not yet tried against the console's plugins.
- 2026-11-07: **First contact with the console.** Copied the Wiiload and
  FTPiiU plugins (from Aisling's Aroma package downloads) to the card.
  `find` and `status` reached the console, then the first send timed out.
  Cause, from the plugin's source (wiiload_plugin `TcpReceiver.cpp`,
  `net.cpp`): one client at a time, backlog 1, and `recvwait` loops forever
  when a client leaves without sending. The tool's own connect-and-close
  port checks on 4299 did that. Fixed: `find` and `status` use FTPiiU (its
  greeting is "220 Hello!"), no test connections to 4299, and
  `test_console_tool.py` fails on any empty connection to its Wiiload
  stand-in. PASS. The jammed plugin clears when the console switches app.

- 2026-11-07: **Build 2 on the console, sent and logged over the network**
  (send 54 s; live log and card log both complete, clean exit). Aisling
  played about 10 minutes: title, menus, track select, one race. Numbers:
  - Title, menus, results: 59.9 fps, no missed frames. Sound: no underruns,
    music never ran dry.
  - Race (124 s): 60 fps in only 60 of those seconds; 22 s at 45-59, 36 s at
    30-44, 6 s below 30. Track select from high up: 19-28 fps.
  - The limit is the CPU's main core, not the GPU: gpuwait about 0 and
    gpulate 0 throughout. Both `game` (upstream update plus the TA shim's
    vertex work) and `draw` (the GX2 backend's conversion) grow with the
    triangle count: about 1.3 us and 0.9 us per triangle, so 13,000
    triangles cost about 30 ms. The swap between 60 and 30 fps as the view
    changes is the stutter.
  - Next: time the parts inside `game` and `draw`, then move the vertex
    work onto the GPU (see the change below).
- 2026-11-07: **Plan change: principle 4, native rendering** (Aisling): the
  port plays like the Dreamcast but is written for the Wii U's hardware,
  with the game's rules, simulation and network data kept as upstream has
  them for cross-play. The old approach copied the Dreamcast's split, with
  vertices worked out on the CPU, which is what holds races under 60 fps.
  M5 gains a native rendering item.
- 2026-11-07: **Native rendering, step (b): render.c's 3D geometry on the
  GPU.** `port/render_native.c` takes strips and meshes from hooks in
  render.c (`DKU_NATIVE`, listed in UPSTREAM.md) with the XMTRX matrix;
  ta.h world batches carry them (indexed, a matrix each); main.vert / the GL
  vertex shader transform; clip z = 0.25 with halfZ clipping cuts at
  upstream's near plane; a depth range of [0, DEPTH_K / 0.25] keeps window
  depth = DEPTH_K / w, so fog and the screen-space path are unchanged.
  Checks:
  - `tools/test_native.sh` (new): GL host autotest with NATIVE=0 and =1 on
    all eight tracks: identical race results, and all 32 pictures match
    under `tools/compare_shots.py` (differences may be lines, not areas;
    a painted 12 px square must fail, and does). The one place they differ
    is Neon Skyway's gate halos, drawn in the same plane as the bands under
    them, where rounding picks the winner (stripy on the CPU path, solid on
    the GPU's).
  - Console autotest, Emerald Beach, before and after: game time in races
    5.5 to 2.1 ms a frame, draw 3.9 to 3.4, CPU average 9.7 to 5.7 ms and
    worst 18.4 to 12.0 ms. PASS.
  - **Found on the console, not in Cemu:** build 4 drew no world (Aisling's
    photo). The console's `GX2SetViewport` makes the depth scale and offset
    for a -1..1 clip z (0.5 and 0.5 for 0..1, logged on the console), but
    halfZ clipping gives 0..1. So depth has always been 0.5 + 0.5 x what was
    meant on the console: the depth clear landed at 0.5 and the world's new
    smaller depth range fell below it. It also means **fog has never shown
    on the console** (fog read every pixel as near). Cemu's version gives 1
    and 0. Fixed by writing the viewport registers directly
    (`set_viewport`). Build 6 on the console: world, karts and distance fog
    drawn; screenshot checked against the host's.
  - **Console screenshots** (new): autotest builds save PPMs to the SD card
    at the host test's frames, fetched over FTP (`TESTING.md`).
  - ~~Cemu ran the GPU path at 15-30 fps with big-endian 32-bit indices
    and at 60 fps with little-endian ones.~~ Wrong (corrected the same
    day, see the step (c) entry): with little-endian indices Cemu draws no
    world at all, which is why it was fast. The console draws both kinds.
- 2026-11-07: **Build 7 on the console: races hold 60 fps** (Aisling played
  a race: "All looked right"). The whole 130 s race at 60 fps with no missed
  frames; track select from high up about 60 fps (was 19-28). World, fog,
  water from up high and power-ups look right, which answers the
  2026-11-06 retest. Sound: no underruns and no dry music in the log, but
  it was played with the sound turned down, so the sound question stays
  open. Left: one-off load hitches at the title and track select, and
  results-screen frames of about 23 ms at 15k triangles (step c).
  Checks, all PASS: `tools/test_native.sh` (8 tracks, 32 pictures),
  `tools/test_host.sh` GL and null-xfcheck, `tools/test_be.sh`,
  `tools/test_saves.sh`, `tools/test_wiiu.sh` (all 8 tracks in Cemu, saves,
  exit, test log, release). One null-xfcheck run failed track 7 with "no
  audio mixed": its log said "no disc", so the run started while the disc
  files were being rebuilt by a parallel build. Three reruns (old and new
  code) passed.
- 2026-11-07: **Console report on build 7: rumble does not work, sound
  does** (Aisling). The GamePad plays its motor pattern at 120 Hz, and the
  port spread a level as single 8 ms bits, too short to spin the motor up.
  Now solid on from level 2, like the remotes; the console accepts every
  call (`DKU RUMBLE ... -> 0` in the log). **Not yet felt on the console**
  (Needs Aisling).
- 2026-11-07: **Native rendering, step (c): the per-frame CPU work.**
  Measured on the console with the Emerald Beach autotest (new `copy`,
  `vert` and `idx` fields in PERF lines), then fixed:
  - 3.2 ms of the 4.0 ms `draw` was copying 10k vertices and 26k indices
    into GPU memory. The TA now builds each frame in place in the GPU
    buffers of the set that draws it (`backend_frame_memory` in ta.h).
    Indices are stored little-endian on every machine (`ta_idx`). Building
    in place first moved 2 ms into `game`: the buffers had left the CPU
    cache, so each first write to a line waited on a read. Claiming the
    lines with `dcbz` at frame start fixed it. Race frame: game + draw
    **6.1 to 2.7 ms** (build 12); core 1 idles about 14 of 16.7 ms.
  - Textures go up in the PVR's own 16-bit formats (GX2 R5G6B5, R4G4B4A4,
    R5G5B5A1, with red and blue swapped back by the component map), so
    the CPU only de-twiddles. Title hitch gone (25 ms); race intro, 21
    textures, 34 to 18 ms. Console screenshots (build 17): colours right.
  - **Cemu correction:** with little-endian indices Cemu draws no world
    (karts and track missing, HUD and sky right); with big-endian ones it
    crashes in Mesa mid-race. Its earlier "60 fps" was drawing nothing.
    The console draws them correctly (screenshots builds 12 and 17), so
    Cemu's checks now cover booting, races, sound, saves and exit, not the
    GPU path's pictures (`tools/test_wiiu.sh` header). Pictures:
    `tools/test_native.sh` on the PC, console screenshots.
  - The rest of step (c), other cores and static geometry on the GPU, is
    not needed at 2.7 ms and waits for split screen or M6 to need it
    (plan item updated).
  - Checks, all PASS: `test_native.sh` (8 tracks), `test_host.sh` null and
    GL (null now fails on any bad batch), `test_be.sh`, `test_saves.sh`,
    `test_wiiu.sh` (8 tracks), console autotest builds 10, 11, 12, 17.
- 2026-11-07: **Rumble still not felt** on release build 17 from the Wii U
  Menu (Aisling), though every `VPADControlMotor` call returns 0. Found:
  the shim read each pad several times a frame, so the GamePad was read
  five times a frame and the motor pattern re-sent every 67 ms; pads are
  now read once a frame (`plat_pad`). Whether that was the cause is not
  known. `VARIANT=rumbletest` tries four ways of driving the motor, method
  N buzzing N times, from 10 s after boot (log lines `DKU PROBE`).
  Build 18 rumbletest on the console: every call returned 0, and Aisling
  felt **nothing from any of the four**. So the motor ignores accepted
  calls whatever the pattern, buffer or rate. **Needs Aisling:** does this
  GamePad rumble in a retail game (e.g. Mario Kart 8, bumping a kart)?
- 2026-11-07: The Wii U Menu started an old build (Aisling): `run` and
  `dev` never kept the build on the card. Sending the release build now
  also replaces the Menu's copy, skipped when the card already has it
  (`.sha256` next to it); test builds leave it alone.
  `test_console_tool.py` PASS with checks for both.
- 2026-11-07: **Rumble parked** (Aisling). The code stays: the console
  accepts its calls, and pads are read once a frame. Not known whether this
  GamePad's motor works at all.
- 2026-11-08: **Upstream updated to `af4eb66`** (8 Nov, 33 commits since
  `eaee474`): Bay City Hills (track 10, a San Francisco street circuit
  with a cable car), Neon Skyway's UFO and freeways, tide online and in Time
  Trial, a drift counter setting, a shared texture pool per track, and
  Rich's move of the renderer, input, profiler and RNG into a shared engine
  (`projects/common/engine`, for his new game Ridgeline). Network build
  32 to **35, minimum 35**: the live server would now refuse the old port.
  - `tools/update_upstream.sh` merged cleanly but deleted `src/render.c` and
    `src/prof.h` with our edits, which moved with them; re-applied in
    `upstream_common/engine/` (UPSTREAM.md). The script now lists edits lost
    to a moved file. `dk_xf_*` became `eng_xf_*` (`port/xform_c.c`
    renamed to match; `xform.S` changed in names only).
  - Shim: `pvr_wait_render_done` (the texture pool waits for it before
    reloading). `sources.mk` takes upstream's new source list and order.
  - Test fixes found on the way: `test_host.sh` ran stale xfcheck programs
    since the `-cpu` folder name (2026-11-07), which was the "no audio"
    flake; it now relinks and runs the right one. `test_native.sh` compared
    music counts (real time, not the race's clock) and timed out on Bay
    City Hills' CPU run; both fixed. Track 10 added to the track lists.
  - Checks, all PASS on all nine tracks: `test_host.sh` null, GL and
    xfcheck, `test_native.sh`, `test_be.sh`, `test_saves.sh`,
    `test_wiiu.sh` (Cemu). Rich's lobby server and `dk-bot` build here with
    Go 1.24 and no downloads, for M6.
- 2026-11-08: **Rich agreed to Wii U consoles on his server** (Aisling:
  "He has given express permission"). Rules changed (CLAUDE.md, section 5):
  release builds use dcvmu.com by default as upstream does (`server.txt`
  still overrides); test builds keep 127.0.0.1 and refuse the live server
  unless built with `DK_AT_LIVE`.
- 2026-11-08: **M6 online.** `tools/test_online.sh` runs upstream's seven
  online scenarios (`upstream/tools/online-qa.sh`) on the PC null build
  against Rich's lobby server built from `upstream/server`, on 127.0.0.1:
  race, custom, practice, spectate, watch, reject, restart, all PASS. Plus
  `wiiu` (the Wii U build in Cemu) and `console` (the Wii U itself, the
  server on this PC's LAN address).
  - `DKU_REALTIME=1` paces the headless build at 60 Hz of wall-clock time,
    since the server and bots keep real time; `TAG=` gives each scenario's
    build a folder of its own (both Makefiles).
  - The server reads the bad word list before it serves and retries a
    failed download for 10 s, so a restarted server missed the game's 6 s
    timeout (the restart scenario). Upstream's harness downloads the list;
    ours gives the server a one-word cached copy and stays offline.
  - **Console: PASS** (build from this commit's tree): connected to the
    PC's server over Wi-Fi, chat filtered as it should be, raced the bot,
    351 remote skid marks, worst remote jump 3.74 m (8 stalls), ping 8 ms.
  - **Cemu keeps only the first remote kart sample**: net.c's
    `t <= h[n - 1].t` (a 64-bit compare, two 32-bit halves sharing one
    condition register result) comes out "stale" for every later sample,
    so remote karts stand on the grid. GCC's code is right, and the
    big-endian PC build (qemu-ppc) and the console store every sample.
    The `wiiu` scenario checks connecting, chat, the race and the place;
    remote motion is checked on the console. Like Cemu's world drawing
    (2026-11-07), this is Cemu's, not the port's.
  - Found on the way: `render_gx2.c` includes the generated `dku_build.h`
    in autotest builds without a make dependency, so a clean parallel
    build could fail; fixed in `Makefile.wiiu`.
  - Chat entry: a USB keyboard via `nsyskbd` (`plat_wiiu.c`; HID codes go
    straight into the KOS-style queue), untried on hardware (Needs
    Aisling). Without one, upstream's on-screen keys type, so `nn_swkbd` is
    dropped. The PC keyboard moves to M7: it also drives pad 0.
