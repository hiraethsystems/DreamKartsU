# The GPU path against the Dreamcast's CPU path (PORT_PLAN.md principle 4).
# For each track, the GL host autotest runs twice on the virtual clock, once
# with NATIVE=0 (render.c transforms, clips and culls on the CPU, as on the
# Dreamcast) and once with NATIVE=1 (port/render_native.c: the GPU does it),
# saving the same frames. The race must play out the same (the autotest's
# results) and the pictures must match, apart from
# the sub-pixel differences of doing the same sums on a different unit
# (tools/compare_shots.py says how close is close). Exit code is the verdict.
#
#   tools/test_native.sh               every raceable track
#   TRACKS="0 7" tools/test_native.sh  some tracks only
